# Repurposing Legacy Equipment: A Home Lab for Network Security with pfSense

Abstract—This project investigates the viability of transforming legacy computing equipment into a personal network security lab using open-source tools. The key components implemented are Suricata, OpenVPN, and pfBlockerNG within a pfSense setup. The resulting environment supports secure access, intrusion detection, and domain/IP filtering, offering a cost-effective alternative for security education and experimentation.
