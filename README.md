# WLAN-Security-Applications-Using-pfSense.

 Abstract—I had more than a decade old equipment sitting in
 my room, collecting dust and being an eyesore. I wanted to sell
 them, but they practically had no resell value. Before throwing
 them away, I decided to give them a last chance. So I spent
 several of my weekends trying to set up an environment for myself
 to practice network security applications, using the open-source
 pfSense Community Edition to implement a Suricata service, an
 OpenVPN instance, and IP and DNS blocking using pfblockerNG
 while making use of existing hardware.
