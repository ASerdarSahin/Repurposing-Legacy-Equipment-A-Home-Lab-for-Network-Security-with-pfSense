# WLAN-Security-Applications-Using-pfSense.

 Abstract—I had more than a decade old equipment sitting
 in my room, collecting dust and being an eyesore. I wanted to
 get rid of them, but they had practically no resell value. Before
 throwing them away I decided to give them a last chance. So I
 spent several of my weekends trying to set up an environment
 for myself to practise network security applications, using open
source pfSense community edition and with minimal spending
 while making use of existent hardware.
